# How to run the IMAGE2012 cosnole performance test                    #

Configuration of Server
=======================
TBD




Running test
============
Tests can be run through the performance.py script in one sweep running in this order:
* Ingest 
* Export
* Delete
* Import
or those steps can be run individually.

In order to run the complete test various parameters have to be passed to the --test argument:
1. path to CSV file containing browse Reports file names to be ingested
2. path to actual browse Reports
3. path to image data
4. path to CSV file containing list of triplets (layerid, starttime, endtime) created by chunks.py script

the --output argument needs one parameter:
1. path where to save output

Example comand for complete test:
---------------------------------
	python performance.py --test performance_test/browseReports.csv performance_test/browseReports/ /var/www/image2012/storage/ performance_test/chunks.csv export/ --output output/


If debug outputs is wanted add --debug flag
In order to pipe into document you can append the following to your test command
	--debug > debug_output.log 2> debug_output.log


Preparation of triplets CSV with create_chunks.py
------------------------------------------

The chunks script takes a path to the browses and an outputfile for the csv file as arguments as well as an output argument where to save modified browse reports.
The goes through all browses solves possible timespan overlaps and rewrites the new times to the outputted browse reports. It creates a csv file with triples (layerid, starttime , endtime). Assuring no overlap each timespan now can be associated with one browse report for export, delete and import methods.

Example command for the create_chunks.py script
-----------------------------------------------
python create_chunks.py --create browseReports/ testTimes.csv --output test/
